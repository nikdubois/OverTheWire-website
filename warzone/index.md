Warzone
========

{% include beginNote.html title="Warzone offline" %}
The warzone is currently offline undergoing an overhaul.
{% include endNote.html %}

The warzone is an isolated network simulating the entire IPv4 Internet, on
which all connected devices are targets to be hacked. Unlike other wargames,
the warzone allows players to connect their own hackable servers or devices
with any software they like, as long as it speaks IP.

The warzone setup gives us the ability to create wargames that are far more
interesting than the ones currently online, such as a games based on
Windows/Android/<enter wacky OS here>, kernel exploitation, advanced network
exploitation, etc.

Currently, we are gathering feedback on the warzone to help steer its development.

{% include beginNote.html title="WARNING" %}
The warzone is an experimental network without any protection. Just like on the
real Internet, your computer is exposed to attacks.  If you connect to the
warzone, use adequate protection (e.g. a firewall).
{% include endNote.html %}

To make the place more interesting, we have created a setup (named tsutomu)
that encourages you to recreate the Mitnick Attack in real life.  More
information on tsutomu can be be found at <http://172.16.66.66> once you are
connected to the warzone.

You may find it helpful to coordinate with others working on tsutomu, to avoid
getting in each others way. To do that, once you are signed up for the warzone,
please join the #wargames channel on ircs.overthewire.org (SSL).

To sign up for the warzone, visit <https://draco.overthewire.org> and ignore the
invalid certificate for now.

Helping out
-----------

Some ways to help beta-test the warzone, are by giving us feedback on the
following points:

* Are the signup instructions clear to you? Did you have any trouble signing up?  
* Is the web interface easy enough to use? Would you recommend any changes? The public repo of the website can be found at <https://github.com/StevenVanAcker/OverTheWire-draco-website>, you may raise issues and send in pull requests for them if you can. 
* What (extra?) information or functionality would you like to see?
