Manpage
=======

### Can you RTFM?

Manpage is a wargame that has been rescued from the demise of
**intruded.net**, previously hosted on manpage.intruded.net. **Big
thanks to adc, morla and reth** for their help in resurrecting this
game!

What follows below is the original description of manpage, copied from
intruded.net:

    Summary:
    Difficulty:     x/10
    Levels:         7
    Platform:   Linux/x86

    Special Thanks:

    Description:
    This game is about breaking some common linux c-programming misconceptions. A good
    tactic when beginning to audit code for the first time is to read the manpages for pitfalls and 
    unusual behavior. Many of these levels were inspired by the famous work of Ilja.

Manpage's levels are called **manpage0, manpage1, ... etc.** and can be
accessed on **manpage.labs.overthewire.org** through SSH on port 2224.

To login to the first level use:

    Username: manpage0
    Password: manpage0

Data for the levels can be found in **/manpage/**.
